      <description>Research 701 ~ Academic Publishing Today&amp;rsquo;s blog is about finding two academic research papers of my choice, which as stated in the first res701 blog will be around data science, machine learning, or deep learning. I stumbled across a gentleman by the name of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber when watching a video on a panel of specialists talking about the current state of AI. At the time I had no clue who he was or what his accomplishments were, but came to know that he was behind the publication of LSTM (long short-term memory) architectures and also the advancements in CNN (convolutional neural networks) architectures.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Spicy Tech This is going to be a continuation of the previous blog, but in this blog we are going to explore a tool thats apart of the docker ecosystem; docker-compose. &amp;ldquo;Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.&amp;rdquo; [source] There is an awesome example found on the getting started section, which shows the power of docker-compose. The example is shown below.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Spicy Tech For our third assessment we are to research and implement a technology of our choice. I am calling it spicy technology, since this is going to be tech that I find awesome or spicy. What better technology to choose than what I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered and come to love; docker. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know of docker, then let me give some background information. &amp;ldquo;Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.</description>

      <description>Research 701 ~ Credibility How can something be credible? Both the oxford dictionary and merriam-webster define credibility as &amp;ldquo;the quality of being believable&amp;rdquo; [source 1] [source 2] This to me is rather dangerous, since things like vaccine hesitancy have gained traction in recent years. This stems from social platforms giving an amplified voice to those who are not credible, but are accepted as credible by others using the social platform(s) for their source(s) of information.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Web Hosting This blog is going to cover web hosting, to make the website publicly available to the outside world. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about web hosting, nor do I care to go into much detail since this is something that a web developer needs to know. As I stated in the web security blog, I have little interest in web development. That being said hosting the website is something that our tutor wants us to get some experience with so here I am writing a blog about it.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Django-cms, Wagtail &amp;amp; Odoo Last blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail around getting the Django based CMSs or Odoo installed/running. This blog is going to cover those in more detail. To recap, as stated in the previous blog, I have no experience with Django but do have some with Odoo. The reason I am working with Django and not the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (Flask) is because Django is a fullstack framwork, where Flask is only a microframework.</description>

      <description>Research 701 ~ Paradigms Postmodernism is a word that I have heard people like Jordan Peterson use but is not a word that I never investigated. It just so happens that postmodernism is one of the paradigms that we talked about in class. The other paradigms are classical and social. One of the take homes is to choose one of the paradigms, describe it, explain what it can be used for, and why I like/dislike the paradigm.</description>

      <description>Why Rust? The first question anyone might ask themselves when they read the title. This is an extremely valid question, since why if one could learn something as simple as Python, would one want to learn a language like Rust? I know this because that was the first question that I asked. The answer is not entirely formulated as I still learn new and exciting things everyday.
The why&amp;rsquo;s What I can say is that for one Rust is fast.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Virtual Machines and Docker Class was mainly reviewing the mock projects, so this blog is going to be dedicated to the virtual machines that I use on virtualbox. For the second milestone we have to describe three frameworks, two of which were prompted in class; laravel (PHP), and meteor (NodeJS). Its times like these that I am thankful for virtual machines. Im not sure how difficult these were to install and get running on windows machines and I dont care to.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ S(ecure) SH(ell) Today in Web701 we learned about SSH so that we can access a remote server for hosting out web technologies on. I have had experience with SSH before since that is how I connect to my raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s and my onion omega, though I prefer the terminal SSH cli to a GUI like putty. Yet another advantage of Linux is that distributions come with SSH pre-installed.</description>

      <description>Today in class the tutor had a set of questions that he wanted us to break up into groups and answer. Reflecting on these questions has only increased the amount questions rather than provide truthful or even a slightly understandable answers. In saying that they are also extremely interesting questions that have a much deeper meaning than anyone could ever percieve or come to understand. These are the answers that resulted after refined discussion internally and with the group I was with.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Security Though web development is not a main focus (or at least front end), I don&amp;rsquo;t spend much time investigating many web technologies/concepts. That being said computer security is a general topic that interests me, and learning the subset internet security is something that one should know. Internet security involves WWW (world wide web), browser, and networking security. Since the internet is insecure, internet securities &amp;ldquo;objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Comparison of frameworks and CMS Todays class covers a comparison of frameworks and CMS. The tutor gave access to an online document with the following questions. We split up into groups, so I will review the answers my group (Bryce, Finn, Deja, and myself).
What is a CMS? A platform that allows non-developers to manage the content of a website
How many are there? Over 9000</description>

      <description>Research 701 ~ Day 0 Res701 is another required class for my bachelor of IT course. This class is based around academic research, where we look at/review academic papers/research methodologies and write blogs about them. Blogs have never been my strong point so I am going to put 110% effort into ensuring consistentcy for this class. I already know what area I am going to be focusing on (data science, machine learning and deep learning), so in that regard I am already ahead of the curve.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Frameworks and VirtualBox Today in web701 we covered the frameworks and softwares that are going to be used for the assessment. The frameworks are laravel (an open-source PHP web framework) and meteor (an open-source NodeJS web framework). The softwares are XAMPP (an open-source web server) and composer (a dependancy manager for PHP). I am going to be installing these on a ubuntu virtual machine, so the first thing I need to do is install virtualbox on my manjaro partition.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 Web development is a required class for my major (software development) in the bachelor of IT. The 701 class is based around information architecture, CMS (content management systems), frameworks and website security. A CMS is essentially a platform which allows a user to change the website without touching any code, usually the form of drag and drops. I don&amp;rsquo;t program using PHP at all, and don&amp;rsquo;t really have any interest in web development so I am going to see if I can use Odoo, since it has a website module that is a CMS.</description>

The first speaker of the day was Kingseley, the event organizer and another favorite of mine. His talk was on gaining information, something I strive to do everyday. There are various ways of gathering information, a few examples can be found below &amp;hellip;
 Reading Listening/watching videos Talking to people Interviewing  Then he explained the various types of questions which include but are not limited to &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Day 5 After needed sleep and again waking up to the usual 7am personal training and a breakfast of a banana/apple. The first speaker of the day was another favorite, Michelle Sharp, the CEO of Kilmarnock. Kilmarnock is a social enterprise (started by Christobel Robinson), which by Michelle&amp;rsquo;s definition is a business model that takes on social issues. She told us about the story of how after 50+ years, Kilmarnock was about to close its doors.</description>

      <description>Day 4 Today as normal we woke and gathered at 7am for personal training, though today&amp;rsquo;s pt was just yoga (which was actually really nice). Then for breakfast I ate the usually banana and apple. Today was the high-ropes course, which I was rather excited for since I had never done something like that before. The first thing we did when we got their was put sunscreen on cause damn it was hot.</description>

I am not one who usually eats breakfast, but I figured I would need the energy so I ate a banana. Our first speaker of the day was a person from the NZ defense force. I will have to re-iterate this section with his name as I cannot remember it and didn&amp;rsquo;t take the opprotunity to write it down.</description>

Looking back I reee internally everytime I think about how much I would have lost if something had happened to my laptops or desktops over the years. Don&amp;rsquo;t be like the 2015 me, take regular backups&amp;hellip; Ever since a friend of mine, Nick got me into Linux I have been learning new things everyday, from built in commands, to the various things that can be done from the terminal.</description>

      <description>I(llusionists) Notebook If you have seen the Prestige, then this program will look familiar. Inotebook is a personal notebook that is encrypted with the vigenere cipher. A vigenere cipher is similar to a caesar cipher (where characters are shifted by a certain offset), but the vigenere cipher uses a key to determine the offset rather than a number. The key is repeated to the length of the message, then each character of the message is offset by the character of the key.</description>

      <description>Partitioning Partitioning? No not mathematics partitions, computer partitions. More specifically hardware partitions (in my case a microSD card). I am officially put off GUIs and am taking a hiatus from them. My raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s microSDD card isn&amp;rsquo;t being used at the moment, so I am formatting it to be used as storage for pcap files that I am capturing on my network. Perfect time to learn how to partition drives from the terminal!</description>

      <description>Tmux - Terminal Multiplexer If you&amp;rsquo;re like me then you use a terminal a lot. If you were me 20 minutes ago then you would also have multiple terminal tabs open with various applications running. I had heard of an application from some of my peers before about the ability to open multiple terminal panes within the same terminal window. For a while I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into it, but then (about 20 minutes ago) I had enough of swapping between terminal tabs and the editor I had been using (vscode).</description>

Krupesh has offered me a permanent position at Venus, so I will be continuing with him and helping to build some amazing stuff.</description>

      <description>Project 702 ~ Problem Solving and Facing Difficulties It never occured to me that problem solving was a skill, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t up until recent that I have come to understand that it falls under conceptual skills. I learned during my studies at Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology that problem solving is in fact the only skill required to be in the IT industry. By my definition or perception all one really needs to know in order to be a good problem solver is how to structure a web search on duckduckgo.</description>

      <title>Prj701 10 ~ Creating an Odoo Module</title>

      <description>PRJ701 - Creating an Odoo Module One of the most powerful things that Odoo brings is the fact that it is open-source. This allows developers like myself to extend the existing structure to fit any use case. To make it even better, Odoo has taken it a step further and provided a built in way to generating the skeleton of an entirely new module. This is done via the scaffold flag when executing odoo-bin.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Sales Module Since the module to be developed involves the sales module, I will be dedicating a blog to exploring the various components that make up the module. For me to better understand what it is I am manipulating or changing I will go through the processes that the sales module provides; half the battle is understanding how it all comes together. One of the resources available to me is the Odoo training center, which contains various tutorials on the different modules, including one for sales.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Setting Up Odoo The first thing I need to do is to ssh into the linux virtual machine that I created on Azure and install a few dependancies. Before I do that I will start with a simple sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get upgrade. Now to install the following dependancies; git python3.5 python3.5-dev virtualenv vim postgresql xz-utils wget fontconfig libfreetype6 libx11-6 libxext6 libxrender1 node-less node-clean-css xfonts-75dpi libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libevent-dev libsasl2-dev libssl1.</description>

      <description>Project 702 ~ Sales Order XML Parse One of the stages in the project is to create a module which provides the functionality of automatically generating a sales order based on the values from an XML file retrived from an FTP server. Before I create a module I am going to create a test-driven example using the standard library ftplib which provides an FTP client, containing the functions (nlist and retrbinary) that are necessary.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Vim I am sure if you have heard of vim then you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t heard good things. I mean hell there are jokes about just exiting vim. Vim (Vi IMproved) is a clone of the vi text editor made by Bill Joy for Unix. When I was first exposed to a text editor (nano) I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very fond of it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense why I would use a text editor over what I was currently using at the time (atom).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Proxmox Networking is one of the IT sectors that I have yet to spend much time in. My only exposure has been a NET501 class where we covered the basics of things like booting a virtual machine, routers/IPs, certificates, dhcp, and a few others. Since then I haven&amp;rsquo;t really touched anything to do with networking except for creation/use of virtual machines on the cloud platforms (GCP, AWS and Azure).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ XML (Extensive Markup Language) I&amp;rsquo;m personally not a fan of XML as I feel it can get to complicated and cluttered, although I do come from a bias of JSON. Even so again this is what I have to learn, so learn I shall. XML to me is just HTML but with more tags so picking up XML shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult. For anything I normally look for documentation or blogs with examples.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is an open source, no-sql (object-relational) database (ORDBMS) which is the db Odoo is built upon. I only have experience with MySQL which is entirely different since, its MySQL relation database management system (RDBMS). I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually used or played around with Postgres so I will be utilizing an awesome blog I found (via quick duckduckgo(ddg) search) which is by the Nanyang Technological University. This blog contains 6 sections with great snippets of quick refence information (I purposely left out the section about PHP cause don&amp;rsquo;t touch that stuff with a 20ft pole).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Azure Part of the stack that is being used for this project is Azure. I am not a fan of microsoft so my opinion on anything to do with them is not positive. This is the cloud provider that Krupesh has chosen to go with however, so I will learn it anyway. Azure (like most cloud providers) gives 200 credits which are only valid for 30 days (GCP and AWS are both a year).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Python (3) I attended a Python meetup group in May 18th 2017. Krupesh was giving a presentation on Python and what it is capable of. The day after this meeting I decided I was going to start learning Python. The first thing I did was make a file containing the basic syntax of the Python programming language. This would become the foundation for what I know today.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Odoo ~ Venus Informatics My 3rd year project proposal started to form without me really knowing it during my first year DAT501(database) class, which at the time was taught by my now best friend Krupesh Desai. At the time Krupesh was working at the NMDHB(Nelson Marlborough District Health Board) on a solution to merge all of the DHB&amp;rsquo;s throughout New Zealand onto one platform. Around May the following year I had met Krupesh again at an ITP (IT Professionals) meeting where I asked him a question on feasability of a malware detecting AI.</description>

      <description>Hello World! What better way to start a blog off than the classical way of starting in programming ~ the ol&amp;rsquo; Hello World! My name is Daniel, I go by OGLinuk as my online handler, and I have a raging passion for IT. Technology has been apart of my life for as long as I can remember, starting with an old windows 98 desktop and an N64. This is where my passion for gaming began, with classics like 007 golden eye, banjo-kazooie, diddy kong racing, donkey kong 64, legoland, and so many more.</description>
