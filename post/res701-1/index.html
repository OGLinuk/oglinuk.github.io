<p>Today in class the tutor had a set of questions that he wanted us to break up into groups and answer. Reflecting on these questions has only increased the amount questions rather than provide truthful or even a slightly understandable answers. In saying that they are also extremely interesting questions that have a much deeper meaning than anyone could ever percieve or come to understand. These are the answers that resulted after refined discussion internally and with the group I was with.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-difference-between-knowing-something-and-having-knowledge-of-something">Is there a difference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?</h3>

<p>Yes, knowing is something that one believes to be true, and knowledge is a belief that a known holds true.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-truth">What is ‘truth’?</h3>

<p>A truth is a known belief. The question then is <em>what does one consider to be known?</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Markdown">If I, you, and me all believe one can't disagree, does that mean that all three 
truly believe one truly agreed?
                ~ one who could not disagree and truly believed
</code></pre>

<p>One does not have to be with another, for one to have a known belief. One can agree with ones&rsquo; self and that already makes two who believe. One who could not disagree and who truly believed, and one who could not agree or even believe.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-really-mean-when-we-say-something-is-true">What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?</h3>

<p>It has been researched or experienced and continues to hold true. If we look at the example above one could argue that &hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-Markdown">                ~ one who could not agree or believe
</code></pre>

<p>This additional one only adds to the truth behind the known. One who could not agree or believe is not able to believe or agree that I, you and me even exists in the first place. Nor could they believe or agree that one cannot disagree, therefore one cannot truly believe one truly agreed. We know there <em>must</em> be one more because of the fundamental law that</p>

<pre><code class="language-Markdown">no one is the only one who can truly know one more, 
therefore someone must be one that knows one truly
                            ~ one who truly knew one more
</code></pre>

<h3 id="is-there-a-difference-between-knowing-something-is-true-and-believing-that-something-is-true">Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?</h3>

<p>Yes. Knowing is experiencing a truth, where as believing is perceiving a truth. To yourself knowing and believing are the same, but to outside, knowing is something that <em>holds</em> true and believing something that <em>can be</em> true or not.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-subjective-and-objective-truth">What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?</h3>

<p>Subjective truth is determined by an individual, since everyone forms an outcome in a different way, where as objective truth is a truth that is true or false and cannot be inferred.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-fact-and-can-facts-change">What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change ?</h3>

<p>A fact is a truth that remains to be true regardless of the number of times it is tested/experienced. Yes facts can change, because facts can be proven wrong due to new knowns or unknowns.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-discover-if-something-is-true-or-not">How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?</h3>

<p>Repetition of the truth until proven untrue. Something can <em>hold</em> true, but could never not be proven wrong. Take for example the statement &ldquo;I am funny.&rdquo; This is a statment that <em>I</em> percieve to be true. Then I am asked to tell a joke and reply &ldquo;there is no place like 127.0.0.1&rdquo;. Does this statement hold true in <em>your</em> perception? Lets say you thought that joke was funny, this means that the statement <em>holds true</em>. Now lets say you didnt think my joke was funny, this means that the statement is no <em>no longer true</em>. That is my perception of how one discovers if something is true.</p>

<h3 id="we-do-not-see-things-as-they-are-but-as-we-are-anais-nin-what-does-this-mean">“We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?</h3>

<p>To me I think that this quote means that we percieve things individually, and so we do not ever truly see things <em>as they are</em>, but as <em>we percieve them to be</em>.</p>

<h3 id="reality-is-an-illusion-albeit-a-very-persistent-one-einstein-what-does-this-mean">“Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” Einstein. What does this mean?</h3>

<p>Reality is continual perception formed by ones knowing and the knowledge of others.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-difference-between-true-and-valid-explain">Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!</h3>

<p>Yes, something that is true can be proven wrong. Validity is a conclusion drawn from truths that cannot be proven. Lets take the funny example again. Lets assume that we both believe that I am funny. From this truth we can percieve that the next person would also believe me to be funny/not funny. We cannot ourselves determine whether the conclusions are true, we can only continue percieving it to be valid until otherwise.</p>

<p>The next set of questions are homework which are the following &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ontology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?</h3>

<p>Ontology is the research of <em>being</em> or one coming to know a <em>state of being</em>. &ldquo;Ontology is the assumptions we make about
the  kind  and  nature  of  reality  and  what  exists.&rdquo;  Snape  and  Spencer  (2003) Lets put this in the form of a thought experiement. What would one say to one&rsquo;s self first, if one had the first thought? Now take a moment and choose your <em>word</em> carefully, because the first one had no knowledge and perhaps knew not of what ones speaks. A word must reflect one in order for one to understand one is referring to someone (though which one, it does not matter). A quick example of this would be when one is speaking of <em>I</em>.</p>

<p>I is one of the ones which one can come to know, but then one must ask;</p>

<pre><code class="language-Markdown">&quot;How does one come to know I?&quot;
                ~ one who knew I not

&quot;I came to no one, therefore one came to know I&quot; 
                ~ one who knew I

                                        ~ one who knew more
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        ~ one who knew less 
                                                ~ one who came to know life
                                                ~ one who came to know death
                                                    ~ 
</code></pre>

<p>This I can truly believe is <em>sound knowledge</em>. I&rsquo;ve added a second section (separated by &mdash;) for anyone who wants to attempt either more ones or counter arguments for why one cannot be. Lets break it down and try to find counter arguments.</p>

<p>First, in order for one to know that one did not know I, one would have had to know (even the smallest amount) about I. Then one can deduce that I cannot come know no one, therefore one must come to know I.</p>

<p>For this, one would have to know I, meaning that one was the one who knew I. One who knew more is the one who <em>must</em> have had that thought or known.One can deduce this because one cannot be no one, but someone had to be the one who knew, and that someone <em>could never</em> be the one who knew not. This could lead to a plethera of other unknowns, but serves as the fundamental laws of what <em>is</em> and <em>what is not</em>. One knows some who is not not, therefore there <em>must</em> be some who know <em>what is not</em>. For example&hellip;</p>

<p>We can both agree that we both percieve there to be words here, but can one truly percieve words outside of reading them? Where does one originate the thought of a word? Is it a mental image in ones mind? Is it a mentally spoken <em>thing</em> that we do not know where or remember first when one came to know of such word?</p>

<pre><code class="language-Markdown">One believes that no one is the only one who can know 
where words first truly came from, because no one can 
know which one said what first. 
                                ~ one who first said what
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who one truly is, because one will never truly know. What <em>does matter</em> is that someone said it first which made one start begin to understand more. The example above demonstrates how one could come to know something, perhaps without even knowing that one did.</p>

<p>To better understand what one believes when one <em>is</em>, one must first understand what one fundamentally believes. That is to say that one must come to know what one does not first, in order for one to know what <em>is</em>, what one does not. How can one truly understand what one believes? One believes that if it is, that is to say it <em>can</em> not, its current state must be <em>is</em> not. The easiest example would be &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>can true be not?
        ~ one who knew true

One believes no one can know a true not, therefore someone must know a not true
        ~ one who knew a true not true

</code></pre>
