<h1 id="day-4">Day 4</h1>

<p>Today as normal we woke and gathered at 7am for personal training, though today&rsquo;s pt was just yoga (which was actually really nice). Then for breakfast I ate the usually banana and apple. Today was the high-ropes course, which I was rather excited for since I had never done something like that before. The first thing we did when we got their was <em>put sunscreen on cause damn it was hot</em>. Then we seperated into groups to do some group activities.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recall all of the activities at the start, but we did all sorts. The most notible one was a triangle post setup with wire running between each one. Our challenge was to get everyone up and stable on the obstacle, which we managed to do rather easily. The instructor gave us a harder challenge of moving 2 people around the entirety of the triangle without anyone falling off. This was certainly more of a challenge.</p>

<p>After the team building challenges it was time for the high-ropes course. We were split up into 2 groups, and our group headed for what the instructor said was the &ldquo;easier of the 2&rdquo;. I was paired up with Regan and Steph and the 3 of us headed to the first obstacle we were allocated which was a high-wire. I was first up since Steph had a fear of heights and I felt if I showed no fear then she would be encouraged. So up the ladder I went and climbed up the pole to the high-wire. Apperantly you were supposed to put one foot on each wire, but I moved across on just one as it felt easier. Not going to lie the heart was pounding a bit, but I had faith in my team. Regan was next and attempted the high-wire and also the high-log, both of which he did great on. Finally was Steph who by this time was in tears, but she worked up the courage to do the high-log, which she did!</p>

<p>Then we swapped with the other group on the other course which was a high-ladder and a trapeze. The high-ladder was the first thing I did, and was relatively easy until the steps gap grew to the size where you could no longer simply reach your hand up and pull yourself up. We went up in groups of 3 so we helped each other progress to the next step along the way. Finally was the trapeze which looked terrifying but when done was not at all (except for being let down).</p>

<p>After the day was done we all went to our usual games of scum (again growing larger) until about 11 or 12.</p>
