      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Spicy Tech This is going to be a continuation of the previous blog, but in this blog we are going to explore a tool thats apart of the docker ecosystem; docker-compose. &amp;ldquo;Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.&amp;rdquo; [source] There is an awesome example found on the getting started section, which shows the power of docker-compose. The example is shown below.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Spicy Tech For our third assessment we are to research and implement a technology of our choice. I am calling it spicy technology, since this is going to be tech that I find awesome or spicy. What better technology to choose than what I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered and come to love; docker. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know of docker, then let me give some background information. &amp;ldquo;Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Web Hosting This blog is going to cover web hosting, to make the website publicly available to the outside world. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about web hosting, nor do I care to go into much detail since this is something that a web developer needs to know. As I stated in the web security blog, I have little interest in web development. That being said hosting the website is something that our tutor wants us to get some experience with so here I am writing a blog about it.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Django-cms, Wagtail &amp;amp; Odoo Last blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail around getting the Django based CMSs or Odoo installed/running. This blog is going to cover those in more detail. To recap, as stated in the previous blog, I have no experience with Django but do have some with Odoo. The reason I am working with Django and not the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (Flask) is because Django is a fullstack framwork, where Flask is only a microframework.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Virtual Machines and Docker Class was mainly reviewing the mock projects, so this blog is going to be dedicated to the virtual machines that I use on virtualbox. For the second milestone we have to describe three frameworks, two of which were prompted in class; laravel (PHP), and meteor (NodeJS). Its times like these that I am thankful for virtual machines. Im not sure how difficult these were to install and get running on windows machines and I dont care to.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ S(ecure) SH(ell) Today in Web701 we learned about SSH so that we can access a remote server for hosting out web technologies on. I have had experience with SSH before since that is how I connect to my raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s and my onion omega, though I prefer the terminal SSH cli to a GUI like putty. Yet another advantage of Linux is that distributions come with SSH pre-installed.</description>
