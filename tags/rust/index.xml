      <description>Alacritty If you use Linux then most likely you also use a terminal. One of the things that I still have not gotten used to after switching from windows is how customizable Linux really is. In this case the terminal. The first thing I asked myself when I came across Alacritty is &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;. It never clicked until rwxrob made a comment about how he was using Alacritty as his terminal.</description>

      <description>Why Rust? The first question anyone might ask themselves when they read the title. This is an extremely valid question, since why if one could learn something as simple as Python, would one want to learn a language like Rust? I know this because that was the first question that I asked. The answer is not entirely formulated as I still learn new and exciting things everyday.
The why&amp;rsquo;s What I can say is that for one Rust is fast.</description>
