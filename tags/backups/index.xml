      <description>Bmus ~ Back Me Up Scotty Taking backups of devices is something that more often than not people don&amp;rsquo;t do, and this includes myself. Prior to my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s I never took backups or even thought about them. Looking back I reee internally everytime I think about how much I would have lost if something had happened to my laptops or desktops over the years. Don&amp;rsquo;t be like the 2015 me, take regular backups&amp;hellip; Ever since a friend of mine, Nick got me into Linux I have been learning new things everyday, from built in commands, to the various things that can be done from the terminal.</description>
