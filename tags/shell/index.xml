      <description>Linux Shell Chapter 2 of The Linux Command Line covers navigation. The commands explored in this chapter are pwd (print working directory), cd (change directory), and ls (list directory contents). I use cd and ls daily, but I don&amp;rsquo;t often use pwd. The structure of the Linux filesystem follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), meaning the filesystem is organized in a tree-like form of directories, which can contain files and other directories.</description>

      <description>Linux Shell If you are using a debian based Linux distribution like I am, then the shell you are using whats called BASH or &amp;ldquo;Bourne Again SHell&amp;rdquo;, which is a GNU project created by Brian Fox. Another amazing human being. If you ever happen to read this blog Brian, thank you. To interact with the shell we use another program called a terminal emulator, which in my case is alacritty (thanks to rwxrob for showing me and the 276 current people working on it).</description>

      <description>Unix Shell It has been almost 3 years since I made the the switch to Linux, and have enjoyed every moment. Like most, I found the terminal to be a daunting thing at first, much like Linux itself. I quickly discovered how much more I enjoyed using a terminal over GUI applications. Though I have gotten by over the past years with the basic commands like cd or rm, I never really dedicated time to improving my skills with the command line.</description>
