      <description>Unix Shell It has been almost 3 years since I made the the switch to Linux, and have enjoyed every moment. Like most, I found the terminal to be a daunting thing at first, much like Linux itself. I quickly discovered how much more I enjoyed using a terminal over GUI applications. Though I have gotten by over the past years with the basic commands like cd or rm, I never really dedicated time to improving my skills with the command line.</description>

      <description>Arch ~ A VirtualBox Installation Arch Linux is one of those things that I&amp;rsquo;ve known about for a long time but have never really gotten around to exploring. I have used manjaro before, which was introduced to me by my friend Sam, but have never used/installed vanilla Arch. This blog is going to cover the steps to setup vanilla Arch using this installation guide which was suggested to me by zer0the0ry.</description>

      <description>Quake 3 ~ ioquake3 I&amp;rsquo;ve covered DOOM in one of my previous blogs. In this blog I am going to cover how to get Quake 3 arena running. The source port I am going to use is ioquake3. Unlike DOOM, there is no entirely free version of Quake 3. Quake 3 requires .pak files, which can found in the game files after purchasing Quake 3 on steam.
The following dependencies are required.</description>

      <description>Alacritty If you use Linux then most likely you also use a terminal. One of the things that I still have not gotten used to after switching from windows is how customizable Linux really is. In this case the terminal. The first thing I asked myself when I came across Alacritty is &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;. It never clicked until rwxrob made a comment about how he was using Alacritty as his terminal.</description>

      <description>Vim I was first introduced to Vim by my good friend Sam. As someone who tries to work as much in the terminal as possible, Vim was perfect for my text editing needs. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve known/used Vim for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s always basic usage for quick edititing, and its always been a secondary editor to Visual Studio Code. This was because I relied heavily on the intellisense when programming in langauges like Go.</description>

      <description>Onion Omega 2 During a Python meetup one of my tutors Mark showed me a new device he had purchased from kickstarter called the onion omega 2. All that I knew at the time was that it was a smaller version of a raspberry pi. When I first got my hands on one I found out it was so much more under the hood. The first things to note is the unit itself needs another component (a dock).</description>

      <description>DOOM DOOM is easily (in my opinion), one of the most iconic games ever made. It is enjoyable to play even to this day. The best part of DOOM is the fact that it has been made open source under a GPL license. From this there have been many source ports of the original DOOM code. I particularly like gzdoom as it adds graphics rending features, but there are quite a few that all have their own unique additions.</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence This is going to be the first of many blogs that I am excited to write as this topic is what peeks my interest within the IT industry and never ceases to amaze me. I was introduced to the field by my good friend Krupesh, who was also the one that got me into Python back in 2017. Since then I knew that my dream career would be within the field of AI.</description>

      <title>Prj701 10 ~ Creating an Odoo Module</title>

      <description>PRJ701 - Creating an Odoo Module One of the most powerful things that Odoo brings is the fact that it is open-source. This allows developers like myself to extend the existing structure to fit any use case. To make it even better, Odoo has taken it a step further and provided a built in way to generating the skeleton of an entirely new module. This is done via the scaffold flag when executing odoo-bin.</description>

      <description>Project 702 ~ Sales Order XML Parse One of the stages in the project is to create a module which provides the functionality of automatically generating a sales order based on the values from an XML file retrived from an FTP server. Before I create a module I am going to create a test-driven example using the standard library ftplib which provides an FTP client, containing the functions (nlist and retrbinary) that are necessary.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Proxmox Networking is one of the IT sectors that I have yet to spend much time in. My only exposure has been a NET501 class where we covered the basics of things like booting a virtual machine, routers/IPs, certificates, dhcp, and a few others. Since then I haven&amp;rsquo;t really touched anything to do with networking except for creation/use of virtual machines on the cloud platforms (GCP, AWS and Azure).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ XML (Extensive Markup Language) I&amp;rsquo;m personally not a fan of XML as I feel it can get to complicated and cluttered, although I do come from a bias of JSON. Even so again this is what I have to learn, so learn I shall. XML to me is just HTML but with more tags so picking up XML shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult. For anything I normally look for documentation or blogs with examples.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is an open source, no-sql (object-relational) database (ORDBMS) which is the db Odoo is built upon. I only have experience with MySQL which is entirely different since, its MySQL relation database management system (RDBMS). I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually used or played around with Postgres so I will be utilizing an awesome blog I found (via quick duckduckgo(ddg) search) which is by the Nanyang Technological University. This blog contains 6 sections with great snippets of quick refence information (I purposely left out the section about PHP cause don&amp;rsquo;t touch that stuff with a 20ft pole).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Python (3) I attended a Python meetup group in May 18th 2017. Krupesh was giving a presentation on Python and what it is capable of. The day after this meeting I decided I was going to start learning Python. The first thing I did was make a file containing the basic syntax of the Python programming language. This would become the foundation for what I know today.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Odoo ~ Venus Informatics My 3rd year project proposal started to form without me really knowing it during my first year DAT501(database) class, which at the time was taught by my now best friend Krupesh Desai. At the time Krupesh was working at the NMDHB(Nelson Marlborough District Health Board) on a solution to merge all of the DHB&amp;rsquo;s throughout New Zealand onto one platform. Around May the following year I had met Krupesh again at an ITP (IT Professionals) meeting where I asked him a question on feasability of a malware detecting AI.</description>
