      <description>PRJ701 - Creating an Odoo Module One of the most powerful things that Odoo brings is the fact that it is open-source. This allows developers like myself to extend the existing structure to fit any use case. To make it even better, Odoo has taken it a step further and provided a built in way to generating the skeleton of an entirely new module. This is done via the scaffold flag when executing odoo-bin.</description>

      <description>Project 702 ~ Sales Order XML Parse One of the stages in the project is to create a module which provides the functionality of automatically generating a sales order based on the values from an XML file retrived from an FTP server. Before I create a module I am going to create a test-driven example using the standard library ftplib which provides an FTP client, containing the functions (nlist and retrbinary) that are necessary.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Proxmox Networking is one of the IT sectors that I have yet to spend much time in. My only exposure has been a NET501 class where we covered the basics of things like booting a virtual machine, routers/IPs, certificates, dhcp, and a few others. Since then I haven&amp;rsquo;t really touched anything to do with networking except for creation/use of virtual machines on the cloud platforms (GCP, AWS and Azure).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ XML (Extensive Markup Language) I&amp;rsquo;m personally not a fan of XML as I feel it can get to complicated and cluttered, although I do come from a bias of JSON. Even so again this is what I have to learn, so learn I shall. XML to me is just HTML but with more tags so picking up XML shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult. For anything I normally look for documentation or blogs with examples.</description>

      <title>Prj701 3 - PostgreSQL</title>

      <description>Project 701 ~ PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is an open source, no-sql (object-relational) database (ORDBMS) which is the db Odoo is built upon. I only have experience with MySQL which is entirely different since, its MySQL relation database management system (RDBMS). I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually used or played around with Postgres so I will be utilizing an awesome blog I found (via quick duckduckgo(ddg) search) which is by the Nanyang Technological University. This blog contains 6 sections with great snippets of quick refence information (I purposely left out the section about PHP cause don&amp;rsquo;t touch that stuff with a 20ft pole).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Python (3) I attended a Python meetup group in May 18th 2017. Krupesh was giving a presentation on Python and what it is capable of. The day after this meeting I decided I was going to start learning Python. The first thing I did was make a file containing the basic syntax of the Python programming language. This would become the foundation for what I know today.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Odoo ~ Venus Informatics My 3rd year project proposal started to form without me really knowing it during my first year DAT501(database) class, which at the time was taught by my now best friend Krupesh Desai. At the time Krupesh was working at the NMDHB(Nelson Marlborough District Health Board) on a solution to merge all of the DHB&amp;rsquo;s throughout New Zealand onto one platform. Around May the following year I had met Krupesh again at an ITP (IT Professionals) meeting where I asked him a question on feasability of a malware detecting AI.</description>
