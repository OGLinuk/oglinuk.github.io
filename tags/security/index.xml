      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Serverless Continued As stated in the previous blog, the first exposure to serverless was OpenFaaS. Whether its because of bias of the first exposure or because of bias towards docker, I am going to be using OpenFaaS for the serverless implementation of assessment three.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Serverless For the third assessment we are to choose a web technology to research and implement. It has to be web related, so one of the things that came up when discussing with my tutor was exploring serverless architectures. I have been exposed to serverless before when I was browsing through /r/opensource and came across OpenFaaS. Before we dive any deeper lets come to an understanding of what we really mean when we are talking about serverless.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Web Hosting This blog is going to cover web hosting, to make the website publicly available to the outside world. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about web hosting, nor do I care to go into much detail since this is something that a web developer needs to know. As I stated in the web security blog, I have little interest in web development. That being said hosting the website is something that our tutor wants us to get some experience with so here I am writing a blog about it.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Django-cms, Wagtail &amp;amp; Odoo Last blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail around getting the Django based CMSs or Odoo installed/running. This blog is going to cover those in more detail. To recap, as stated in the previous blog, I have no experience with Django but do have some with Odoo. The reason I am working with Django and not the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (Flask) is because Django is a fullstack framwork, where Flask is only a microframework.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Virtual Machines and Docker Class was mainly reviewing the mock projects, so this blog is going to be dedicated to the virtual machines that I use on virtualbox. For the second milestone we have to describe three frameworks, two of which were prompted in class; laravel (PHP), and meteor (NodeJS). Its times like these that I am thankful for virtual machines. Im not sure how difficult these were to install and get running on windows machines and I dont care to.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ S(ecure) SH(ell) Today in Web701 we learned about SSH so that we can access a remote server for hosting out web technologies on. I have had experience with SSH before since that is how I connect to my raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s and my onion omega, though I prefer the terminal SSH cli to a GUI like putty. Yet another advantage of Linux is that distributions come with SSH pre-installed.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Security Though web development is not a main focus (or at least front end), I don&amp;rsquo;t spend much time investigating many web technologies/concepts. That being said computer security is a general topic that interests me, and learning the subset internet security is something that one should know. Internet security involves WWW (world wide web), browser, and networking security. Since the internet is insecure, internet securities &amp;ldquo;objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.</description>
