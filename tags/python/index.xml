      <description>Web Development 701 ~ OpenFaas ~ Lab 4 In this blog we are going to go through lab 4 which goes into more depth around functions.
The first part of the lab covers configuration injection with environment variables. There are two ways of doing so; at deployment time and using query string and HTTP headers. Environment variables at deployment time are covered in lab 3 when working with write_debug, which is where the environment variable is added to the YAML file.</description>

      <description>Docker-compose In this blog we are going to explore a tool thats apart of the docker ecosystem; docker-compose. &amp;ldquo;Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.&amp;rdquo; [source] There is an awesome example found on the getting started section, which shows the power of docker-compose. The example is shown below.
app.py
import time import redis from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) cache = redis.Redis(host=&#39;redis&#39;, port=6379) def get_hit_count(): retries = 5 while True: try: return cache.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ OpenFaas Continued ~ Lab 3 In this blog we are going to explore the OpenFaas workshop. Since we already have OpenFaas deployed and running from the previous blog, we are going to skip to lab 3; introduction to functions. OpenFaas provides two ways of creating a new function; using a template, or using an existing binary. I dont have a binary to use, so I am going to be using a template.</description>

      <description>Docker Back in 2017 I learned about a ton of new and exciting technologies that I had never used or even heard of. One of those technologies is docker. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know of docker, then let me give some background information. &amp;ldquo;Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.&amp;rdquo; [source]. Before we can dive further into what this really means we need to first come to an understanding of containerization.</description>

      <description>I(llusionists) Notebook If you have seen the Prestige, then this program will look familiar. Inotebook is a personal notebook that is encrypted with the vigenere cipher. A vigenere cipher is similar to a caesar cipher (where characters are shifted by a certain offset), but the vigenere cipher uses a key to determine the offset rather than a number. The key is repeated to the length of the message, then each character of the message is offset by the character of the key.</description>

      <title>Prj701 10 ~ Creating an Odoo Module</title>

      <description>PRJ701 - Creating an Odoo Module One of the most powerful things that Odoo brings is the fact that it is open-source. This allows developers like myself to extend the existing structure to fit any use case. To make it even better, Odoo has taken it a step further and provided a built in way to generating the skeleton of an entirely new module. This is done via the scaffold flag when executing odoo-bin.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Sales Module Since the module to be developed involves the sales module, I will be dedicating a blog to exploring the various components that make up the module. For me to better understand what it is I am manipulating or changing I will go through the processes that the sales module provides; half the battle is understanding how it all comes together. One of the resources available to me is the Odoo training center, which contains various tutorials on the different modules, including one for sales.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Setting Up Odoo The first thing I need to do is to ssh into the linux virtual machine that I created on Azure and install a few dependancies. Before I do that I will start with a simple sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get upgrade. Now to install the following dependancies; git python3.5 python3.5-dev virtualenv vim postgresql xz-utils wget fontconfig libfreetype6 libx11-6 libxext6 libxrender1 node-less node-clean-css xfonts-75dpi libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libevent-dev libsasl2-dev libssl1.</description>

      <description>Project 702 ~ Sales Order XML Parse One of the stages in the project is to create a module which provides the functionality of automatically generating a sales order based on the values from an XML file retrived from an FTP server. Before I create a module I am going to create a test-driven example using the standard library ftplib which provides an FTP client, containing the functions (nlist and retrbinary) that are necessary.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Vim I am sure if you have heard of vim then you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t heard good things. I mean hell there are jokes about just exiting vim. Vim (Vi IMproved) is a clone of the vi text editor made by Bill Joy for Unix. When I was first exposed to a text editor (nano) I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very fond of it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense why I would use a text editor over what I was currently using at the time (atom).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ XML (Extensive Markup Language) I&amp;rsquo;m personally not a fan of XML as I feel it can get to complicated and cluttered, although I do come from a bias of JSON. Even so again this is what I have to learn, so learn I shall. XML to me is just HTML but with more tags so picking up XML shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult. For anything I normally look for documentation or blogs with examples.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is an open source, no-sql (object-relational) database (ORDBMS) which is the db Odoo is built upon. I only have experience with MySQL which is entirely different since, its MySQL relation database management system (RDBMS). I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually used or played around with Postgres so I will be utilizing an awesome blog I found (via quick duckduckgo(ddg) search) which is by the Nanyang Technological University. This blog contains 6 sections with great snippets of quick refence information (I purposely left out the section about PHP cause don&amp;rsquo;t touch that stuff with a 20ft pole).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Azure Part of the stack that is being used for this project is Azure. I am not a fan of microsoft so my opinion on anything to do with them is not positive. This is the cloud provider that Krupesh has chosen to go with however, so I will learn it anyway. Azure (like most cloud providers) gives 200 credits which are only valid for 30 days (GCP and AWS are both a year).</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Python (3) I attended a Python meetup group in May 18th 2017. Krupesh was giving a presentation on Python and what it is capable of. The day after this meeting I decided I was going to start learning Python. The first thing I did was make a file containing the basic syntax of the Python programming language. This would become the foundation for what I know today.</description>

      <description>Project 701 ~ Odoo ~ Venus Informatics My 3rd year project proposal started to form without me really knowing it during my first year DAT501(database) class, which at the time was taught by my now best friend Krupesh Desai. At the time Krupesh was working at the NMDHB(Nelson Marlborough District Health Board) on a solution to merge all of the DHB&amp;rsquo;s throughout New Zealand onto one platform. Around May the following year I had met Krupesh again at an ITP (IT Professionals) meeting where I asked him a question on feasability of a malware detecting AI.</description>
