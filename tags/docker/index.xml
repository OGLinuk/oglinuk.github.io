      <description>Docker-compose In this blog we are going to explore a tool thats apart of the docker ecosystem; docker-compose. &amp;ldquo;Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.&amp;rdquo; [source] There is an awesome example found on the getting started section, which shows the power of docker-compose. The example is shown below.
app.py
import time import redis from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) cache = redis.Redis(host=&#39;redis&#39;, port=6379) def get_hit_count(): retries = 5 while True: try: return cache.</description>

      <description>Docker Back in 2017 I learned about a ton of new and exciting technologies that I had never used or even heard of. One of those technologies is docker. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know of docker, then let me give some background information. &amp;ldquo;Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.&amp;rdquo; [source]. Before we can dive further into what this really means we need to first come to an understanding of containerization.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Django-cms, Wagtail &amp;amp; Odoo Last blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail around getting the Django based CMSs or Odoo installed/running. This blog is going to cover those in more detail. To recap, as stated in the previous blog, I have no experience with Django but do have some with Odoo. The reason I am working with Django and not the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (Flask) is because Django is a fullstack framwork, where Flask is only a microframework.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Virtual Machines and Docker Class was mainly reviewing the mock projects, so this blog is going to be dedicated to the virtual machines that I use on virtualbox. For the second milestone we have to describe three frameworks, two of which were prompted in class; laravel (PHP), and meteor (NodeJS). Its times like these that I am thankful for virtual machines. Im not sure how difficult these were to install and get running on windows machines and I dont care to.</description>
