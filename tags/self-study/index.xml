      <description>Self Study 1 With the first semester of the last year finished the 2 week break has begun. I am very close to graduating, only 2 more electives to complete. Not entirely sure what electives I am going to choose as of yet, but I do know that I want to get into a good routine now that my bachelor degree is nearing the end. I have created a daily schedule which I am going to follow for ideally the rest of my life that I believe will be utilizing the most of the time I have.</description>

      <description>Self Study 1 2018 is over and 2019 has just begun. I have learned a lot over the past couple of years and still have much more to learn. For this reason I have decided to make a tag called self-study. There is a list that I have started to make of the various skills/technologies/libraries/concepts/etc&amp;hellip; that I have picked up over the last 3 years which I will be improving upon in this sub-set of blogs.</description>
