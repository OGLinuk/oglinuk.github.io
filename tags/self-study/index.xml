      <description>Self Study 1 2018 is over and 2019 has just begun. I have learned a lot over the past couple of years and still have much more to learn. For this reason I have decided to make a tag called self-study. There is a list that I have started to make of the various skills/technologies/libraries/concepts/etc&amp;hellip; that I have picked up over the last 3 years which I will be improving upon in this sub-set of blogs.</description>
