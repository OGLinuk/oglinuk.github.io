      <description>Vim I was first introduced to Vim by my good friend Sam. As someone who tries to work as much in the terminal as possible, Vim was perfect for my text editing needs. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve known/used Vim for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s always basic usage for quick edititing, and its always been a secondary editor to Visual Studio Code. This was because I relied heavily on the intellisense when programming in langauges like Go.</description>
