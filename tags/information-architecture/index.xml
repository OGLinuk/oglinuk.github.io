      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Security Though web development is not a main focus (or at least front end), I don&amp;rsquo;t spend much time investigating many web technologies/concepts. That being said computer security is a general topic that interests me, and learning the subset internet security is something that one should know. Internet security involves WWW (world wide web), browser, and networking security. Since the internet is insecure, internet securities &amp;ldquo;objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Day 2 Today in web701 we covered the frameworks and softwares that are going to be used for the assessment. The frameworks are laravel (an open-source PHP web framework) and meteor (an open-source NodeJS web framework). The softwares are XAMPP (an open-source web server) and composer (a dependancy manager for PHP). I am going to be installing these on a ubuntu virtual machine, so the first thing I need to do is install virtualbox on my manjaro partition.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 Web development is a required class for my major (software development) in the bachelor of IT. The 701 class is based around information architecture, CMS (content management systems), frameworks and website security. A CMS is essentially a platform which allows a user to change the website without touching any code, usually the form of drag and drops. I don&amp;rsquo;t program using PHP at all, and don&amp;rsquo;t really have any interest in web development so I am going to see if I can use Odoo, since it has a website module that is a CMS.</description>
