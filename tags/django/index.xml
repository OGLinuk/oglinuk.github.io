      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Heroku and Web Hosting We wrapped up the web implementation in the last blog with the addition of the auction system. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to deploy the website to a web hosting service. There are two options that are available for the deployment, my tutors remote server, or a PaaS (Platform as a Service) provider like Heroku.
I want to get experience in both so I will deploy on both, but since the dependancies I require for the website are not yet installed on the tutor&amp;rsquo;s server I will start with deploying on Heroku.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Auction System (cont.) In the last blog we covered authentication with the TradeMe API. After some playing around, I hit a wall with the list an item API method. Instead of wasting time trying to figure it out I am going to implement a simple dummy auction system. This is partly because I&amp;rsquo;d rather have something for an auction system than nothing and also partly because I have more important projects to work on.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Auction System With the authentication and calculator finished its now time to implement the auction system. For this feature I am going to be implementing it using the TradeMe API. This is partially because there is no existing auction extension in django and partially because I love API&amp;rsquo;s and this is a perfect opportunity to get experience integrating one.
The first thing to do is to head over and read the registering an application section.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Price Calculator In the previous blog we implememented the functionality around editing and updating the user profile. Now that we have completed that feature requirement for the assessment, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to implement another of the feature requirements; the price calculator.
To start we are going to create a new app called calculator to keep things cleaner and easier. We do this by django-admin startapp calculator.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Profile (editing) Last blog covered extending the user model of Django to add additional fields and then implementing a profile page. In this blog we are going to cover editing and updating the profile information. The first thing to do is to add the following to the urlpatterns variable in the urls.py file.
path(&#39;edit_profile&#39;, views.edit_profile, name=&#39;edit_profile&#39;)  Next to create the edit_profile view in the views.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Profile In the previous blog we implemented the registration functionality. Now to add additional fields when registering and a profile page for users. In this blog we are going to explore extending the user model. The first thing we need to do is to create a new class in the models.py file in our authentication app. To this file we are going to add the following code.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Registration In the previous blog we covered the basic implementation of authentication using the built-in authentication system of Django. In this blog we are going to cover how to handle user registration. The first thing to do is to add the following line to the urls.py file under our authentication app.
path(&#39;register&#39;, views.register, name=&#39;register&#39;)  Now to create the corresponding view in the views.py file.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Authentication In this blog post we are going to cover the implementation of user authentication. First thing to do is to create a new app via python3 manage.py startapp authentication. Next we need to run python3 manage.py migrate. Then we need to create a super user via python3 manage.py createsuperuser. Now we need to add authentication to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the settings.py file. Once that is done we can start to add the authentication functionality.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Assessment 2 Milestone 3 Since I have completed milestone&amp;rsquo;s 1 and 2 for assessment 2 of web701, I am going to start milestone 3 (building the proposed website). I have chosen to use Django since Django is more suitable for a production environment than Flask. Originally I was going to use Django-cms, but quickly found that it would not be as easy to implement some of the features required for the milestone.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Django-cms, Wagtail &amp;amp; Odoo Last blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail around getting the Django based CMSs or Odoo installed/running. This blog is going to cover those in more detail. To recap, as stated in the previous blog, I have no experience with Django but do have some with Odoo. The reason I am working with Django and not the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (Flask) is because Django is a fullstack framwork, where Flask is only a microframework.</description>
