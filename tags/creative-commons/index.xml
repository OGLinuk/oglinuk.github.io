      <description>Research 701 ~ Copyright vs Copyleft Todays class was around creative commons, which is a permissive license designed as a better alternative to copyright. We were shown a video which covered how copying is not stealing. Makes sense if you think about it. Copying is taking something and making a duplicate of it, where as stealing is taking something and leaving nothing.
There is a website called choosealicense which clearly describes the use cases/scenarios that a certain license would cover.</description>
