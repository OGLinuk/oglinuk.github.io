      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Serverless Continued As stated in the previous blog, the first exposure to serverless was OpenFaaS. Whether its because of bias of the first exposure or because of bias towards docker, I am going to be using OpenFaaS for the serverless implementation of assessment three.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Serverless For the third assessment we are to choose a web technology to research and implement. It has to be web related, so one of the things that came up when discussing with my tutor was exploring serverless architectures.

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Web Hosting This blog is going to cover web hosting, to make the website publicly available to the outside world. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about web hosting, nor do I care to go into much detail since this is something that a web developer needs to know. As I stated in the web security blog, I have little interest in web development. That being said hosting the website is something that our tutor wants us to get some experience with so here I am writing a blog about it.</description>
