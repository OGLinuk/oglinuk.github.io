      <description>Web Development 701 ~ Virtual Machines and Docker Class was mainly reviewing the mock projects, so this blog is going to be dedicated to the virtual machines that I use on virtualbox. For the second milestone we have to describe three frameworks, two of which were prompted in class; laravel (PHP), and meteor (NodeJS). Its times like these that I am thankful for virtual machines. Im not sure how difficult these were to install and get running on windows machines and I dont care to.</description>

      <description>Web Development 701 ~ S(ecure) SH(ell) Today in Web701 we learned about SSH so that we can access a remote server for hosting out web technologies on. I have had experience with SSH before since that is how I connect to my raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s and my onion omega, though I prefer the terminal SSH cli to a GUI like putty. Yet another advantage of Linux is that distributions come with SSH pre-installed.</description>
