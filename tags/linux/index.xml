      <description>Bmus ~ Back Me Up Scotty Taking backups of devices is something that more often than not people don&amp;rsquo;t do, and this includes myself. Prior to my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s I never took backups or even thought about them. Looking back I reee internally everytime I think about how much I would have lost if something had happened to my laptops or desktops over the years. Don&amp;rsquo;t be like the 2015 me, take regular backups&amp;hellip; Ever since a friend of mine, Nick got me into Linux I have been learning new things everyday, from built in commands, to the various things that can be done from the terminal.</description>

      <description>Partitioning Partitioning? No not mathematics partitions, computer partitions. More specifically hardware partitions (in my case a microSD card). I am officially put off GUIs and am taking a hiatus from them. My raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s microSDD card isn&amp;rsquo;t being used at the moment, so I am formatting it to be used as storage for pcap files that I am capturing on my network. Perfect time to learn how to partition drives from the terminal!</description>

      <description>Tmux - Terminal Multiplexer If you&amp;rsquo;re like me then you use a terminal a lot. If you were me 20 minutes ago then you would also have multiple terminal tabs open with various applications running. I had heard of an application from some of my peers before about the ability to open multiple terminal panes within the same terminal window. For a while I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into it, but then (about 20 minutes ago) I had enough of swapping between terminal tabs and the editor I had been using (vscode).</description>
